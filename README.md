## Description
Welcome to the database that shares scientific information about fruits, vegatables, grains, gourds, and more! I built this React application because I love food and nerdy, fun facts. 

<!-- [Check out this two-minute video walkthrough of my app](https://youtu.be/APgdl-WwKyM) and [my blog post](https://dev.to/laurentyson85/utilizing-a-nested-get-request-3dj9) about the project; in the blog, I delve into some cool features! -->


## Installation

To install, please fork and clone this repository. Once you've cloned it to your terminal, make sure you ``cd`` into the correct folder. 


## Usage

After you're in your correct folder, run ``json-server --watch db.json`` in your terminal. Then, in a new terminal window, run ``npm start``. The app will open in your borwser and you can take it for a spin!


## Credit

This application utilizes mock API food data from [Retool Utilities](https://retool.com/utilities/) which I edited to include food facts. The header logo was created on [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)
